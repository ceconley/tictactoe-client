Tic Tac toggle

Into

This game is Tic Tac Toe. You play on a 3x3 board and play either 'X' or 'O' marker
Players will alternate turns until someone wins or until the board in full and no one wins.
The goal is to get three of your markers in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally….
And that’s pretty much it.

Planning Process

I started by building out a wire frame and putting together user stories.  Then I took the user stories and converted them into notes in my text editor to build my code around.  I ran into multiple problems along the way. But I used the jQuery.com documentation to solve jQuery issues.  I also used w3school and stackoverflow to research other issues.  Anything I couldn’t find an answer to, I submitted to our issue queue.

Unsolved Problems

In the next iteration, I will add functionality to connect the authentication fields to an API for the ability to create and account and track games.  I will also improve the styling to make it more visually appealing.
